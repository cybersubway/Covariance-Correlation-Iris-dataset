# Covariance-Correlation-Iris-dataset
The iris dataset, which comprises feature vectors including "sepal length," "sepal width," "petal length," and "petal width," categorizes flowers into three distinct groups: "versicolor," "setosa," and "virginica." Covariance and correlation are two crucial measures based on the dependence of feature vectors on one another; no libraries were utilized in the computation of these metrics, which are computed from scratch in this code file. All code is written from scratch.
